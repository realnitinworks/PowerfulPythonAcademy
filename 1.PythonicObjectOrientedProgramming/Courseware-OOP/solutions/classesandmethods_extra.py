Let's create a class to manage invoices. Its constructor will take
an invoice number, the customer name, and the amount of money owed.

>>> invoice = Invoice(12, 'Mark Smith', 42.50)
>>> invoice.number
12
>>> invoice.customer
'Mark Smith'
>>> invoice.amount
42.5

And we'll keep track too of the total payments made. At first, this
will be zero.

>>> invoice.total_payments
0

Now, the customer may make payments in stages (rather than paying all
at once).  So let's create methods to add payments, check whether the
invoice is fully paid off, etc.

>>> invoice.add_payment(20)
>>> invoice.is_fully_paid()
False
>>> invoice.total_payments
20
>>> invoice.amount_due()
22.5

>>> invoice.add_payment(22.50)
>>> invoice.is_fully_paid()
True
>>> invoice.amount_due()
0.0

Sometimes, a customer will submit one large payment for several
invoices. And it may only partially cover one of them. Create a
CustomerAccount class to manage the nuances of this.

>>> customer_name = 'James Jones'
>>> account = CustomerAccount(customer_name)

Did you know Python class objects have a __name__ attribute?
>>> type(account).__name__
'CustomerAccount'
>>> account.name
'James Jones'

The add_invoice() method takes an instance of the Invoice class.

>>> account.add_invoice(Invoice(1, customer_name, 20.0))
>>> len(account.invoices)
1
>>> account.total_due()
20.0
>>> account.add_invoice(Invoice(2, customer_name, 25.0))
>>> len(account.invoices)
2
>>> account.total_due()
45.0
>>> account.add_invoice(Invoice(3, customer_name, 30.0))
>>> len(account.invoices)
3
>>> account.total_due()
75.0

>>> unpaid = account.unpaid_invoices()
>>> len(unpaid)
3
>>> type(unpaid[0]).__name__
'Invoice'
>>> unpaid[0].number
1
>>> unpaid[0].amount
20.0

>>> account.apply_payment(20)
>>> now_unpaid = account.unpaid_invoices()
>>> len(now_unpaid)
2
>>> now_unpaid[0].number
2
>>> account.total_due()
55.0

>>> account.apply_payment(10)
>>> account.total_due()
45.0
>>> len(account.unpaid_invoices())
2

>>> account.apply_payment(45)
>>> len(account.unpaid_invoices())
0

        # Again, you can do this more simply with a comprehension:
        return [ invoice for invoice in self.invoices
                 if not invoice.is_fully_paid() ]

    def apply_payment(self, amount):
