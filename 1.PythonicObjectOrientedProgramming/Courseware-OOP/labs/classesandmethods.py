"""

Let's create a class to manage invoices. Its constructor will take
an invoice number, the customer name, and the amount of money owed.

>>> invoice = Invoice(12, 'Mark Smith', 42.50)

The built-in isinstance() tells you whether an object is an instance of
a given class or not.
>>> isinstance(invoice, Invoice)
True

This object has some member variables:
>>> invoice.number
12
>>> invoice.customer
'Mark Smith'
>>> invoice.amount
42.5

We want to keep track too of the total payments made. At first, this
will be zero.

>>> invoice.total_payments
0

Now, the customer may make payments in stages (rather than paying all
at once).  So let's create methods to add payments, check whether the
invoice is fully paid off, etc.

>>> invoice.add_payment(20)
>>> invoice.is_fully_paid()
False
>>> invoice.total_payments
20
>>> invoice.amount_due()
22.5

>>> invoice.add_payment(22.50)
>>> invoice.is_fully_paid()
True
>>> invoice.amount_due()
0.0
