Welcome to "Pythonic Object-Oriented Programming"!

A few notes:

Python 3.7 or later is *required* for this class. Though 3.6
is likely to work for most exercises. If you are using Python 2.7,
please read PYTHON2.txt in this courseware after you complete the course.

This folder has course materials you will use in the class:

* slides - Slide decks used in the class.

* labs - In-class programming exercises. Your instructor will lead you
  through them.

* solutions - Solutions to the labs. IMPORTANT: We've found that
  students learn and retain FAR MORE when you only peek at solutions
  when you truly, absolutely need a hint to get un-stuck. Always do as
  much as you can on your own, so you'll learn a lot! When you are
  done, THEN always compare what you wrote to the official solution;
  if it's any different, that will teach you even more.
